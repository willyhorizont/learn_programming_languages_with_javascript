kotlin -version

Compile the application using the Kotlin compiler:
    kotlinc filename.kt -include-runtime -d filename.jar
The -d option indicates the output path for generated class files, which
may be either a directory or a .jar file. The -include-runtime option makes the resulting .jar file self-contained and
runnable by including the Kotlin runtime library in it.

Run the application:
    java -jar filename.jar
or
    kotlin filename.jar

Compile and run the application
    kotlinc filename.kt -include-runtime -d filename.jar && kotlin filename.jar
