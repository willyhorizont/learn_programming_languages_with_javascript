In this repository, I am attempting to learn every programming language that has behavior and capabilities similar to JavaScript, like:
1. variable can store dynamic data type and dynamic value, variable can inferred data type from value, value of variable can be reassign with different data type
2. has option to make variable can store dynamic data type and dynamic value
3. object/dictionary/associative-array/hash/hashmap/map/unordered-list-key-value-pair-data-structure can store dynamic data type and dynamic value
4. array/list/slice/ordered-list-data-structure can store dynamic data type and dynamic value
5. support passing functions as arguments to other functions
6. support returning functions as values from other functions (closure)
7. support assigning functions to variables
8. support storing functions in data structures like array/list/slice/ordered-list-data-structure or object/dictionary/associative-array/hash/hashmap/map/unordered-list-key-value-pair-data-structure

HOW TO RUN THE CODES:

1. cd codes/javascript/src
2. node filename.js

to run Python code:
1. cd codes/python
2. python filename.py

to run PHP code:
1. cd codes/php
2. php ./filename.php

to run Go code:
1. cd codes/go/foldername
2. go run filename.go

to run Perl code:
1. cd codes/perl
2. perl filename.pl

to run Julia code:
1. cd codes/julia
2. julia filename.jl

to run Lua code:
1. cd codes/lua
2. lua filename.lua

to run Ruby code:
1. cd codes/ruby
2. ruby filename.rb

to run R code:
1. cd codes/r
2. Rscript filename.r

to compile and run Kotlin code:
1. cd codes/kotlin
2. kotlinc filename.kt -include-runtime -d filename.jar && kotlin filename.jar
